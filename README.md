# CSCI 4701: PyTorch Code from Kernel to Convolutional Neural Networks

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- matplotlib  
- skimage  
- torch  
- torchvision  

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install them manually).
2. Open the notebook `CNN.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run each cell in order to train and evaluate the model.

## Project Structure
- `CNN.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for the Convolutional Neural Network model.
